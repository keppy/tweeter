tweeter
=======

A twitter interface built with angular.
Utilizing the [yeoman](http://yeoman.io/)
The [angular-generator](https://github.com/yeoman/generator-angular) helped me organize client side code.
The [rails-api](https://github.com/rails-api/rails-api) gem helped me keep things slim.

Rails files can be found in ./twitter_api

The angular files are in ./app/scripts
